# Text Editor with encryptor
## Commands used to compile dynamic lib:
``` g++ -Iheaders source/*.cpp main.cpp -o TextEditor -Lsource -lCAlib```
## TestPlan
There was a lot of different test plans in 1st and 2nd assignments, so i would make just for encrypting and decrypting:

1. 1 -> abcd
2. 3 -> 2
3. 4
4. 5 -> (make sure file was loaded successfully)
5. 0
